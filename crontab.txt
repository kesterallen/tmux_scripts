# The tmux list-s lists all tmux sessions currently running. If there aren't any, nothing else happens.
# If there is one or more tmux sessions running, each pane is listed with 
#     * session name
#     * window index
#     * pane index
#     * window name
#     * the current working directory in the pane
#     * the ID of the process running in the pane, if there is one, otherwise an empty string
#
# This tmux pane listing is tee-ed to a tmpfile, and STDOUT is then used to
# extract just the running-process ID, and pipe that through 'ps -oargs' (the
# -h suppresses header printing) to get the actual command that is being run.
# THIS text is then put in a second tmpfile, and the two tmpfiles are pasted
# together columnwise to create a sing file.
#
# TODO: there's probably a ps flag that would print an empty line, which would
# remove the need for the bash call to '|| echo;
